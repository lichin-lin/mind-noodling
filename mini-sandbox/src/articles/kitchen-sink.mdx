# Markdown Kitchen Sink

This post exercises **many** markdown features so we can verify MDX rendering.

---

### Level 3 heading

Some body text under a heading. It includes _italic_, **bold**, and `inline code`.

<br />

### Lists

- Unordered item one
- Unordered item two
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

1. Ordered item one
2. Ordered item two
3. Ordered item three

- [ ] Task not done
- [x] Task completed

<br />

### Blockquote

> This is a quote. It should feel subtle and readable.

<br />

### Code blocks

Here is a JavaScript example:

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`)
}

greet('Mini Sandbox')
```

And a plain fence without language:

```
Just some plain text code block
with multiple lines.
```

```js title="Plain block"
const message = 'Hello CodeBlock'
console.log(message)
```

```js title="With line numbers" showLineNumbers
const first = 1
const second = 2
const third = first + second
console.log({ first, second, third })
```

```js title="Highlighted lines" showLineNumbers lines={[2,4]}
function greet(name) {
  const message = `Hello ${name}`
  console.log(message)
  return message
}
greet('Simpleflow')
```

```js title="Word highlight" showLineNumbers
const article = {
  title: 'How Simpleflow was built',
  slug: 'simpleflow',
}
console.log(article)
```

<br />
