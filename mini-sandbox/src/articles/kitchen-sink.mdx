# Markdown Kitchen Sink

This post exercises **many** markdown features so we can verify MDX rendering.

## Headings

### Level 3 heading

Some body text under a heading. It includes _italic_, **bold**, and `inline code`.

## Lists

- Unordered item one
- Unordered item two
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

1. Ordered item one
2. Ordered item two
3. Ordered item three

- [ ] Task not done
- [x] Task completed

## Blockquote

> This is a quote. It should feel subtle and readable.

## Code blocks

Here is a JavaScript example:

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`)
}

greet('Mini Sandbox')
```

And a plain fence without language:

```
Just some plain text code block
with multiple lines.
```
