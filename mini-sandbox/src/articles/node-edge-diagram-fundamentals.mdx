# Building Interactive Workflow Diagrams

A diagram begins with a simple question: **how do I make complexity visible?** Not just visible—manipulable, explorable, alive. The kind that updates when your system changes, that reveals structure you couldn't see in text or tables.

We'll start from the most fundamental primitive and work our way up to layout algorithms that organize nodes automatically.

### 1. The Empty Canvas

It all starts with space. An infinite, blank surface waiting for structure.

To map a system, we first need to identify its landmarks. We could call these **nodes**. Before we worry about connections or flows, we must simply give these pieces a place to exist.

<Example1 />

The act of positioning is powerful. By placing things near or far, aligned or scattered, you are already defining relationships.

### 2. Drawing Connections

Once the nodes are in place, we started to draw lines. These lines are the relationship made visible. It turns a collection of isolated parts into a cohesive system. Suddenly, we can see how data flows, where dependencies lie, and how one piece of the puzzle influences another.

### 3. When Manual Breaks Down

But things can easily get out of control. With more and more nodes on the canvas, relationships become complicated and we start to get lost in the diagram.

<Example3 />

**This is the breaking point.** What felt intentional with a few blocks now feels like chaos. Manual positioning doesn't scale. The diagram has outgrown our ability to manage it by hand.

---

### 4. Algorithms as Collaborators

This is where we start exploring layout algorithms. To tame the chaos, we need a systematic way to organize these elements.

One of the most popular approaches is the **Sugiyama framework** (Layered Graph Drawing). Introduced by Kozo Sugiyama in [1981](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4308636), it revolutionized how we visualize hierarchical structures. The goal is simple but powerful: arrange nodes in layers so that edges flow in a single direction (usually top-to-bottom) with minimal crossing.

<Example4 />

With the algorithm in charge, the diagram suddenly makes sense. We have moved from manual placement to **structural clarity**.

---

### 5. Smooth Paths

Now that we have structure, we can refine how connections flow between nodes. Straight lines work, but curved paths guide the eye more naturally. They soften the visual noise and make complex hierarchies easier to trace.

<Example5 />

---

### 6. Bringing Edges to Life

Static lines show structure, but they don't convey **state**. Is data flowing? Is a process running? Are dependencies being resolved in real-time?

By animating particles along the edges, we add meaning. The moving dots represent data traveling from one node to the next, making the diagram feel alive and responsive.
